With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you
really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then
my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.

the current column of the current alignment.
Try to go on, since this might almost work.

simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace

you're probably due for more error messages, and you
